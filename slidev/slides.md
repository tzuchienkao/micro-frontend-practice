# What are Micro Frontends?

<h4>The End Of 2016</h4>
<p>First came up in ThoughtWorks Technology Radar.</p>


<h4>Concepts</h4>
<p>The idea behind Micro Frontends is to think about a website or web app as a composition of features which are owned by independent teams.<br>Each team has a distinct area of business or mission it cares about and specialises in.<br>A team is cross functional and develops its features end-to-end, from database to user interface.</p>

<h4>Core Ideas behind Micro Frontends</h4>

- **Be Technology Agnostic**
  + Each team should be able to choose and upgrade their stack without having to coordinate with other teams.<br>Custom Elements are a great way to hide implementation details while providing a neutral interface to others.

- **Isolate Team Code**
  + Donâ€™t share a runtime, even if all teams use the same framework.<br>Build independent apps that are self contained.<br>Don't rely on shared state or global variables.

- **Establish Team Prefixes**
  + Agree on naming conventions where isolation is not possible yet.<br>Namespace CSS, Events, Local Storage and Cookies to avoid collisions and clarify ownership.

- **Favor Native Browser Features over Custom APIs**
  + Use Browser Events for communication instead of building a global PubSub system.<br>If you really have to build a cross team API, try keeping it as simple as possible.

- **Build a Resilient Site**
  + Your feature should be useful, even if JavaScript failed or hasn't executed yet.<br>Use Universal Rendering and Progressive Enhancement to improve perceived performance.
